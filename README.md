# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
This project aims to use data science and analysis to help determine what conditions make a computer vulnerable to attacks. The insights could help technology companies make better antivirus software as well as design more robust computers that can withstand malware.

Created in python using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pyspark packages. It uses Logistic regression, random forests and gradient boosted trees for the analysis.
